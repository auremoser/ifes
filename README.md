Simple repo to store sample charts. Demo [here](http://auremoser.github.io/ifes/).

### Charts

Here are some charts we considered making:

Round 1

* **time series** # reports over time
* **bar graph stacked or group** reporter counts by month/week for both trusted and untrusted reporters

Round 2

* **line chart** reported incident count by political party of perp
* **line chart** reported incident count by political party of victim
* **bar chart** incident count by violence type
* **pie** report count by source (SMS/Phone/Fax...)
* **grouped bar chart** incident perps by gender / incident victims by gender

### Demo

These are demos with fake data based on a loose understanding of a few goals: chart x/y display, likely data format, desire for interactivity and filtering, desire to export in various file formats.
