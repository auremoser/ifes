Simple repo to store sample charts. Demo [here](http://auremoser.github.io/ifes/).

### Charts

Here are some charts we considered making split into two rounds. Otherwise updated references can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFUhsO084gAbB8VIjfNDDXWoMrBmF3XLa6QyKHRyMC8/edit?usp=sharing).

Round 1

* **time series** # reports over time
* **time series** reporter counts by month/week for both trusted and untrusted reporters
* **pie chart** regions and subregion counts for reports/incidents
* **pie chart** gender % by perp/victim
* **grouped bar graph** violence types by month
* **grouped bar** impact times (violence/vandalism)

Round 2

* **stats/counts** generated based on predefined and desired figures for reports
* **summary form** # of reports over time with a dominance of _ party and _ types of perps/victims
* **grouped bar graph** political parties associated with reports as perps/victims
* **line chart** post-facto analysis: graphic comparing violence report counts to elections statistics
* **standard chart set** for comparison across deployments by: 1.Location, 2.Report count, 3.Violence Type, 4. Impact type, 5. Gender balance involved

### Demo
View the latest charts [here](http://auremoser.github.io/ifes/)!

These are demos with fake data based on a loose understanding of a few goals: chart x/y display, likely data format, desire for interactivity and filtering, desire to export in various file formats.
